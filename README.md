## Facies Classification
This [notebook](https://github.com/Philliec459/facies_classification/blob/master/Facies%20Classification%20-%20SVM%20-%20MATT.ipynb) is from Brendon Hall. It is a great demonstration of using a machine learning algorithm (support vector machine) to assign facies to well log data.  This is great work from Brendon. 

The training data from Brendon has been assembled based on expert core description combined with wireline data from nine wells.  These data are used to train a support vector machine to identify facies based only on wireline log data. Supervised training. This is based on a class exercise from the University of Kansas that can be [found online](http://www.people.ku.edu/~gbohling/EECS833/).  

The only think that we have dome is update this repository on our fork to be compatible with Python 3.7. Brendon has done it all other that a few compatibility updates. 

Please review the Jupyter Notebooks (Facies Classification - SVM - MATT.ipynb and Facies Classification - SVM.ipynb) written by Brendon. They show a step by step discussion of the code, concepts and example plots as shown below. These Notebooks are actual code and the plots are the results from running the code in the Notebook.
