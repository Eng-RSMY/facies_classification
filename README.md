## Facies Classification
This [notebook](https://github.com/brendonhall/facies_classification/blob/master/Facies%20Classification%20-%20SVM.ipynb) from Brendon Hall is a demonstration of using a machine learning algorithm (support vector machine) to assign facies to well log data.  Training data from Brendon has been assembled based on expert core description combined with wireline data from nine wells.  This data is used to train a support vector machine to identify facies based only on wireline log data.  This is based on a class exercise from the University of Kansas that can be [found online](http://www.people.ku.edu/~gbohling/EECS833/).  We are in the process of updating this repository on this fork to be compatible with Python 3.7.
